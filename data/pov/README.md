 Poverty data from the World Bank

__Source: [World Bank, World Development Indicators](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/themes/poverty-and-inequality.html)__

The World Bank WDI database provides a comprehensive collection of global development indicators on different topics
including poverty and inequality. Reducing poverty is central to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
and the World Bank's goal by 2030. However, poverty is defined and measured differently across the world. 

The data files provide data on poverty headcounts at different poverty lines, as well as contextural data on
population. Data is available at the country and regional level at a yearly frequency.
