# Global Health Expenditure Data

__Source: [WHO Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED)](https://apps.who.int/nha/database)__

The Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED) provides comprehensive data on 
health expenditures across countries, allowing for detailed analysis and 
comparison of health spending patterns since 2000. The database contains 
detailed breakdowns of health expenditure including by health care functions,
by diseases and conditions, spending for the under 5-year-old population, and 
spending by provider type, as well as capital investments.

Data files listed below provide data on health expenditure for countries 
at an annual frequency in different units (e.g. current US dollars, percentage of GDP, etc.).
Data is available for total health expenditure, broken down by source (domestic general government, external, 
domestic private, and household out-of-pocket health expenditure. _Note: domestic private health expenditure includes household 
out-of-pocket_), and by disease/condition categories (including
subcategories for infectious diseases e.g. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, etc.).
